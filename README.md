RPi RGB LED has pre-defined LED patterns which you can quickly chain together to create your own sequences.

This is built on top of the [`rpi-ws281x`](https://github.com/rpi-ws281x/rpi-ws281x-python) library.

## Key Features

## Usage

## Setup

There are two parts to the set-up: wiring the circuit and installing required Python packages. Luckily, both are easy.

### Wiring the Circuit

You only need the following hardware:
* Raspberry Pi 4B
* WS2812 or SK6812 RGB LED strip
* Three jumper wires

Connect them according to the diagram below:


### Installing

Install the following packages:

```
$ sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x
$ sudo pip3 install tkinter
$ sudo pip3 install ttkthemes
$ sudo pip3 install tkcolorpicker
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
